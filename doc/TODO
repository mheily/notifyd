* Add a state_mount () function  to do a mount nullfs of the global state directory to a 
directory of the users choice, so that root daemons can chroot and still access state.

* Switch from using linked lists to hashes for internal state data, so that it can scale to
larger numbers of pub/sub names.

* Implement the libdispatch-related API functions

* Add a state_atexit() function that deallocates all internal state and is the companion
to state_init(). This will make valgrinding possible in the future.
